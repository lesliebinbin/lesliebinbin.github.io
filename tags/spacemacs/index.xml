      <description>Sup, guys. Here we go, Spacemacs really rocks. It is one of the emacs distributions, perhaps the most popular one among community driven.  It is either Vim or Emacs that should be the editor for some one for a life time, as for me, no doubt it is Emacs.  There will be multiple posts about how to configure spacemacs for programming, receiving emails, listen to spotify and other cool stuff.</description>
